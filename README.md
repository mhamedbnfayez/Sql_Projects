# SQL Projects: Data Wrangling & Analysis

This repository showcases my proficiency in SQL, focusing on various techniques for data cleaning, transformation, manipulation, and analysis.

## Key Highlights:

    - Real-World Scenarios: Explore practical projects that address common data wrangling challenges and prepare data for insightful analysis.
    - Diverse Techniques: Delve into projects that leverage a range of SQL functions, joins, aggregations, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs).
    - Code Examples: Examine well-structured SQL scripts demonstrating efficient data manipulation and analysis approaches.
    - Improved Data Quality: Witness how these projects transform raw data into a cleaner, more consistent format ready for further exploration and visualization.

## Project Navigation:

Each folder within this repository represents an individual SQL project. Within each folder, you'll typically find the following files (if applicable):

    - SQL Scripts (.sql): The core SQL code files for data manipulation and analysis.
    - Data Files (.csv, .xlsx, etc.): The raw data used in the project.
    - Documentation (.txt, .md): Additional details, explanations of complex queries, and expected outcomes.

Feel free to explore the individual projects and delve into the world of data wrangling with SQL!

## Technologies & Tools:

    - SQL (Structured Query Language)
    - DBMS: PostgreSQL.
